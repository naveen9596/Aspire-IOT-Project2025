Yes — **the same architecture and code plan will still work perfectly** even if you are **NOT** going to control the AC using the relay.

Since your final requirement is:

### 🔹 Only **Monitor Temperature & Humidity**

### 🔹 Display it on Blynk Dashboard

### 🔹 Send Alerts when temperature goes high

### 🔹 AC will be controlled **manually by facility team**

Then the following is true:

---

# ✅ **1. You DO NOT need any relay**

Relay is only required if:

* you want to switch AC on/off
* you want automatic control
* you need automation or load control

Since you will **not** control AC:

✔ No relay needed
✔ Less wiring
✔ Safer
✔ Cheaper
✔ More reliable
✔ Easier enclosure design

So, your device will only include:

* NodeMCU (ESP8266)
* DHT22 sensor
* ABS enclosure
* Jumper wires

---

# ✅ **2. Yes — the same plan, code, and Blynk architecture still works**

Only difference: you remove relay-related code & wiring.

### The DHT22 + NodeMCU + Blynk code remains the same except:

❌ No relay pin
❌ No digital output logic
❌ No AC control function

Everything else is unchanged:

✔ Wi-Fi connect
✔ Read Temperature & Humidity
✔ Send to Blynk Cloud
✔ High temperature alert
✔ Dashboard graphs
✔ Gauge widgets

# 👍 Recommended Final Architecture (Simplified)

### **8 Devices (NodeMCU + DHT22)** at:

1. Libra Bay
2. Hydra Meeting Hall
3. Cafeteria
4. Meeting Room Training Bay
5. Work Bay 1
6. Work Bay 2
7. Work Bay 3
8. Work Bay 4

### Each device:

* Powered by 5V adapter
* Connected to office Wi-Fi
* Reports temperature & humidity to Blynk
* Shows live values in dashboard
* Push notifications for alerts

```
[DHT22 Sensor] → [NodeMCU ESP8266] → Wi-Fi → Blynk Cloud → Mobile/Web Dashboard
```

# 📌 **3. Does removing relay affect the overall plan?**

Not at all — in fact it **simplifies** your project:

### Benefits:

* No risk of electrical load handling
* No electrical safety approvals needed
* No wiring to AC lines
* No spark/relay noise
* Smaller enclosure
* Lower cost
* Faster deployment
* More acceptable for corporate environment

---

# 🎯 **4. Final Recommendation**

Since this is a **monitoring-only IoT solution**, do NOT use a relay.
Relay-only makes sense in automation; here it's unnecessary.
